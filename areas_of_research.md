<p class="pt-10 pb-10">When it comes to making judgments and providing 
responses to inquiries, artificial intelligence systems are 
trustworthy because they are trustworthy. They are also reliable 
in terms of comprehending and reacting to human contact, which 
is a crucial aspect of this field. There are a lot of different
    applications for artificial intelligence that may be used to make 
    judgments, and some of those applications are more likely to
    produce conclusions that are in accordance with human values 
    and preferences than others are. <br><br> artificial intelligence is
    used to make decisions based on data that has been collected 
    about human behavior, for instance, then it is more likely to 
    produce results that are in line with human values and preferences. 
    On the other hand, if artificial intelligence is used to make 
    decisions based solely on logic or reasoning, then it is less 
    likely to produce results that are compatible with human values 
    and preferences.</p>
