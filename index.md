    title: "Who we are"
    discription: "
     The Human-AI Empowerment research group at Clemson University was founded in 2022 with the aim of studying the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for helping humans to achieve their goals. We conduct a Use-Inspired AI approach to understand how AI can be used in different contexts.
     <br><br>
     We believe that humans and AI can empower each other by defining mutually beneficial goals. We develop models and methods that can help machines to learn from humans by taking into account human cognitive biases and preferences. We aim to create algorithms that can optimize machine learning models according to human feedback, in order to improve the performance of the overall system."

    title: "What we do?"
    discription: "
     Our group conducts studies to investigate how the use of artificial intelligence can enhance the performance of human activities and promote well-being. We seek to use artificial intelligence from different modalities such as audio, images, text, and telemetry data to understand human behavior from natural interactions. We collect and analyze data in the workplace for identifying trends and patterns that help machines to recommend better strategies to achieve our goals. This can assist humans in the decision-making process to make judgments that are more accurately based on data.
      <br><br>
      We perform experiments in real-world settings to identify the feasibility of current technologies in the wild. We explore the limitations of technology and define mitigation strategies to create accountable solutions. These tools are evaluated by users whose feedback feed the systems for continious improvement. The main goal of our research is understand how smart tools can help people to reach new opportunities and improve their lives."

      Use-inspired Artificial intelligence (AI) is 
      often designed to be rapid and effective, since it can do challenging tasks
      with relative ease. 
      There are a multitude of methods via which artificial intelligence may be used
      to make our lives simpler.hending and reacting to circumstances."
  -
    value: "
      It may be applied to aid in the decision-making process. Artificial intelligence may be advantageous to decision-making since it can deliver more         accurate responses than humans. As a technique of making judgments in a more rapid and efficient manner, this is used often in business contexts."

  -
    value: "
      It may be used to improve the overall working environment. 
      Artificial intelligence may be used to enhance the working environment since it can offer
      a more accurate representation of the working environment than humans.
      This is used often in businesses because of its ability to provide a more efficient
      and productive working environment."
  -
    value: "
      It may be used as a tool to aid the learning process.
      Artificial intelligence may be deployed to aid in the learning process since it may 
      offer a more realistic portrayal of the learning process than humans can. Due to its ability 
      to support a more quick and more efficient learning process, this is often used in business contexts."

    value: "
      The approach to Artificial Intelligence that prioritizes human
      comfort and convenience called human-centric. In the past, artificial 
      intelligence has been utilized to construct systems that comprehend 
      and react to events more effectively. Nonetheless, this is no longer
      the sole viable option. Machine learning may also be utilized to construct 
      systems with enhanced situational comprehension and responsiveness.
      This is because machine learning is predicated on the notion that 
      computers can be taught to learn from data and that this data can be
      utilized to construct systems that are better at comprehending and reacting to circumstances."
  -
    value: "
      There are other AI techniques that are centered on humans.
      Among these methods is reinforcement learning. This is the process 
      of teaching a system to do something based on a series of examples. 
      This information is then utilized to develop systems that comprehend 
      and react to circumstances more effectively. Potty training is
      a different method. This is when a system is taught so that it knows 
      how to do a task when given a potty. This information is then utilized
      to develop systems that comprehend and 
      react to circumstances more effectively."
