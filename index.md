    The Human-AI Empowerment research group at
    Clemson University is one of the few research organizations in 
    the world whose only objective is the advancement and application
    of artificial intelligence on a worldwide scale. Our research 
    is based on the development of what is known as "human-centered 
    computing," which is designed to be helpful to people in both an 
    effective and efficient manner.
    <!-- We have made the creation of AI 
    research tools and software a top priority in order to aid people
    and countries in developing the most sophisticated AI technology 
    that is practically possible. All across the world's academic 
    institutions are represented in the artificial intelligence 
    research group's membership. -->

    Machine learning algorithms, 
    natural language processing systems, and deep learning systems
    are just some of the AI-related research tools that our team 
    of researchers has begun developing and is now in the process 
    of building. We are developing AI-based software and solutions 
    that have the potential to be used in a wide range of fields, 
    such as the medical field, the educational system, and the 
    corporate world.
